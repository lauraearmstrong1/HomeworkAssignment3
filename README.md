# About the website:

This website provides the user the opportunity to generate a random password. The user can click the "generate password" button which will prompt them to choose how long the password should be (8-128 characters), as well as if it should include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and/or symbols. Once the user picks their preferences, a random password is generated and placed in the text box.
